## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **@datocms/cma-client-node**: Official DatoCMS TypeScript SDK
- **n8n-workflow**: n8n node development framework

### Resources & Operations

#### Records Resource
- `create`: Create new content records with ResourceMapper field interface and auto-publish option
- `upsert`: Create or update records using external/business field matching (e.g., external ID, slug, SKU) with integrated ResourceMapper matching field selection - optimized for business identifiers, not internal DatoCMS IDs
- `get`: Retrieve single record by ID
- `getAll`: List all records filtered by content type with advanced field filtering
- `update`: Update existing records by internal DatoCMS Record ID with ResourceMapper field interface and auto-publish option
- `delete`: Remove records
- `publish`: Publish draft records
- `unpublish`: Unpublish live records

#### Upload Resource
- `create`: Upload files from binary data or remote URLs (images, documents, etc.) with optional collection assignment
- `get`: Retrieve upload information by ID
- `getAll`: List all uploads with optional collection filtering
- `delete`: Remove uploaded files

#### Item Type Resource
- `getAll`: List all available content models
- `get`: Get specific content model details

### Dynamic Features
- **loadOptions Method**: Automatically populates content type dropdowns from DatoCMS API
- **ResourceMapper Integration**: Automatically loads field schemas for visual mapping
- **Localization Detection**: Automatically detects and marks localized fields
- **Environment Support**: Works with DatoCMS environments (main, sandbox, etc.)
- **Binary Data Handling**: Supports file uploads through n8n's binary data system

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Development with watch mode
npm run dev

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Development Workflow

When making changes to the node:

1. **Make your code changes** in TypeScript files
2. **Build the project**: `npm run build` (required for changes to take effect)
3. **Restart n8n**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart `npx n8n` 
4. **Test changes** in n8n interface
5. **Commit changes**: `git add` and `git commit`

**Important**: Always rebuild after code changes, as n8n loads the compiled JavaScript from the `dist/` directory, not the TypeScript source files.

## Local Testing

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed instructions on testing the node locally during development.

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Build and link for testing
npm run build
mkdir -p ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes && npm link /absolute/path/to/n8n-nodes-datocms
npx n8n
```

The node will appear as "datocms" (not "n8n-nodes-datocms") in the n8n interface.

## Usage in n8n

1. **Install the node** in your n8n instance
2. **Configure credentials** with your DatoCMS API token
3. **Select resource type** (Record, Upload, Item Type)
4. **Choose operation** based on what you want to do
5. **Configure parameters** using the dynamic dropdowns

### Example Workflows

#### Filtering Records (Get Many)
The Get Many operation now supports advanced filtering by field values, allowing you to search for specific records based on custom fields or system fields.

**Example: Find records by external ID**
1. Resource: Record
2. Operation: Get Many
3. Item Type: [Select from dropdown]
4. Add Filter:
   - Field: external_id
   - Operator: Equals
   - Value: ABC123

**Example: Find recently updated records**
1. Resource: Record
2. Operation: Get Many
3. Item Type: [Select from dropdown]
4. Add Filter:
   - Field: Updated At
   - Operator: Greater Than
   - Value: 2024-01-01T00:00:00

**Example: Find records with specific status**
1. Resource: Record
2. Operation: Get Many
3. Item Type: [Select from dropdown]
4. Add Filter:
   - Field: status
   - Operator: In
   - Value: active, pending

**Available Operators:**
- **Equals**: Exact match
- **Not Equals**: Does not match
- **Greater Than/Less Than**: For numbers and dates
- **In/Not In**: Match any/none of comma-separated values
- **Exists**: Field has a value (not null)

**Filterable Fields:**
- All system fields (ID, Created At, Updated At, Status, etc.)
- All custom fields except Modular Content and Structured Text
- Localized fields are supported
- Fields marked as (Unique) for easy identification

#### Creating a Blog Post
1. Resource: Record
2. Operation: Create
3. Item Type: [Select from dropdown]
4. Fields: Use ResourceMapper to map fields visually:
   - Regular fields: Enter values directly
   - Localized fields: Use JSON format like `{"en": "My Post", "de": "Mein Beitrag"}`
5. Auto Publish: âœ…

#### Syncing External Data (Upsert)
1. Resource: Record
2. Operation: Upsert
3. Item Type: [Select from dropdown]
4. Fields: Use ResourceMapper to map fields visually
   - **Matching Fields Section**: Select field(s) to match on (e.g., "external_id", "slug", "SKU")
   - **Field Mapping Section**: Map all other fields
   - **Automatic Detection**: First unique field is pre-selected as matching field
5. Create If Not Found: âœ… (default: true)
6. Auto Publish: âœ… (optional)

This is perfect for sync processes where you have external/business IDs and want to update existing records or create new ones if they don't exist. The integrated ResourceMapper provides native n8n matching field selection with automatic field reloading. The operation uses optimized API filtering for fast performance, even with large datasets, and includes both draft and published records in the search.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Integrated Matching**: No separate field dropdown - matching fields are configured directly in the ResourceMapper
- **Business-Focused**: Excludes internal DatoCMS ID field - designed for external identifiers
- **Auto-Reload**: When you reload fields, matching options are automatically updated
- **Smart Defaults**: First unique field is automatically selected as the default matching field

#### Uploading an Image
**From Binary Data:**
1. Resource: Upload
2. Operation: Create
3. Upload Source: Binary Data
4. Binary Property: data
5. Include Other Input Fields: âœ… (optional - preserves input data for mapping)
6. The uploaded file can then be linked to records

**From URL:**
1. Resource: Upload
2. Operation: Create
3. Upload Source: URL
4. File URL: https://example.com/image.jpg
5. Skip Creation If Already Exists: âœ… (default)
6. Upload Collection: [Optional: Select from dropdown]
7. Include Other Input Fields: âœ… (optional - preserves input data for mapping)
8. The uploaded file can then be linked to records

#### Filtering Uploads by Collection
1. Resource: Upload
2. Operation: Get All
3. Return All: âœ… (or set limit)
4. Filter by Collection: [Optional: Select specific collection]
5. Returns only uploads from the selected collection

#### Upload Input Field Mapping
The upload create operation includes an **"Include Other Input Fields"** option that allows you to preserve input data alongside the DatoCMS upload response. This is particularly useful for mapping workflows where you need to correlate input data (like source URLs) with the resulting DatoCMS upload IDs.

**Example Use Case:**
- **Input**: `{ "source_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg", "category": "blog", "alt_text": "My Image" }`
- **Upload**: Creates DatoCMS upload from the URL
- **Output**: `{ "source_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg", "category": "blog", "alt_text": "My Image", "id": "upload_123", "url": "https://datocms.com/uploads/...", ... }`

This enables you to:
1. **Map URLs to IDs**: Connect original source URLs to DatoCMS upload IDs
2. **Preserve Metadata**: Keep additional information (categories, alt text, etc.) from the input
3. **Enable Complex Workflows**: Build multi-step processes that reference both input and output data

**How to Use:**
1. Enable "Include Other Input Fields" in the upload create operation
2. The original input fields will be merged with the DatoCMS response
3. DatoCMS fields take precedence in case of field name conflicts

#### Working with Special Field Types

**Localized Fields (Multi-language content):**
1. **Field Detection**: Localized fields are automatically detected and marked with "(Localized)" in the field name
2. **JSON Format**: Use JSON format to provide content for each locale:
   ```json
   {
     "en": "English content",
     "de": "German content", 
     "it": "Italian content"
   }
   ```
3. **Auto-parsing**: The node automatically converts JSON strings to the correct DatoCMS format

**Required Fields:**
- Automatically detected and protected from removal in the ResourceMapper UI
- Cannot be accidentally deleted from field mapping

**Unique Fields:**
- Marked with "(Unique)" indicator to show they must have unique values
- Helps prevent duplicate content errors

**URL Fields:**
- Automatically validated with n8n's URL field type
- Prevents invalid URL formats from being submitted

**Enum Fields:**
- Display dropdown options with predefined values when supported
- Limits input to valid choices defined in DatoCMS schema

## Configuration

### Credentials Setup
- **API Token**: Your DatoCMS management API token
- **Environment**: Target environment (default: "main")
- **Base URL**: DatoCMS API endpoint (default: "https://site-api.datocms.com")

### Environment Variables
Set these in your DatoCMS project:
- `DATOCMS_API_TOKEN`: Your API token
- `DATOCMS_ENVIRONMENT`: Target environment (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Failed to load item types"**: Check API token permissions
2. **Upload errors**: Ensure binary data is properly formatted
3. **Publishing failures**: Verify record exists and is in draft state
4. **GetAll operations showing as single item**: Ensure you've rebuilt after code changes and restarted n8n

### Development Tips
- Use the built-in credential test to verify API connectivity
- Check the n8n logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure your DatoCMS project has the required content models
- Always rebuild (`npm run build`) after making code changes
- Restart n8n completely after rebuilding to load new changes
